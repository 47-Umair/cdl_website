    <span class="maintext">How the Amazon Career Choice Program Works</span>
    <p class="financing">
     If you wish to pursue a truck driving or other in-demand career, then you can receive full or partial tuition assistance through this unique program. As long as your program is covered under their in-demand careers like truck drivers are, then your program may qualify.<br><br>

     Most programs covered by Amazon Career Choice are two-year associate’s degrees or vocational certifications. Besides transportation, other common industries include computer science, electrical and mechanical trades, construction, information technology, and healthcare.

  <span class="maintext">Amazon Career Choice Benefits</span>
  <p class="financing">The specific benefits depend on program eligibility. IEC DBA Drivers School is a covered program, so you can qualify for up to 100-percent tuition coverage for you to train to receive your CDL. For other programs, you may receive partial assistance for tuition, books, and fees.</p>
  <span class="maintext">How To Become Eligible for the Program</span>
  <p class="financing">In order to apply for tuition coverage through this program, you must first be hired as an Amazon hourly employee. You must also be employed for at least 90 days. The specific programs covered by this program vary, so you may need to apply or wait for approval if you’re applying to a program that isn’t part of the approved partner network.<br><br>

  While this program isn’t currently available for salaried Amazon employees, you won’t be dismissed from the program if you’re promoted during your Career Choice Program studies. Instead, you can still continue to receive tuition assistance for your program until you complete it.</p>
