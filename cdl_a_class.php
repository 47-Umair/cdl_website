      <span class="maintext">What Are the Requirements for a Class A CDL License?</span>
      <p class="financing">Review the current requirements to find out if you’re ready to enroll in a CDL training program. Before you enroll in a training program and take a Class A driver’s license exam, you’ll need to meet the age requirements and medical requirements.<br><br>

        The minimum age to become eligible for interstate driving employment is 21 years old. There aren’t any regulations on maximum age, so you can continue to drive as long as you pass the medical requirements.
        <br><br>

      Medical CDL license requirements are met by scheduling a medical examination. Here are some key medical qualifications that may be required to receive your CDL:</p>

      <ul class="text-center lists">
        <li><p>No impairment or loss of arm, leg, hand, foot, or other features that may impair your ability to operate a commercial vehicle</p></li>
        <li><p>No established history or clinical diagnosis of high blood pressure, myocardial infarction, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, or related diagnoses</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to pass hearing and vision tests</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="financing">
        These are just a few areas you must pass to become medically qualified to earn a CDL. A Department of Transportation physical will go over all the specific medical issues that may prevent you from safely driving a truck. If you are unable to pass some of these requirements there may be waivers that can be obtained through the FMCSA medical programs division.
