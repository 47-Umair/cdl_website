      <span class="maintext">CDL Training From a CDL Driving School</span>
      <p class="financing">CDL training from a leading CDL truck driving school prepares you to not only receive your CDL license but also drive successfully with a leading carrier. Explore the requirements to earn a CDL Class A license and choose a school that offers the training you need to take the test and start your new career.<br><br>

      The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration sets the minimum CDL license requirements for students looking to earn a CDL Class A license. The two basic requirements are related to your age and medical history:</p>

      <ul class="text-center lists">
        <li><p>Be at least 21 years old</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="#" class="text-primary">Undergo a medical examination</a></p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="financing">
        The medical examination helps determine whether you’re physically qualified to drive. The goal of this examination is to ensure drivers who complete CDL truck driving schools are safe on the road. Driving a tractor-trailer when you’re too young or have a severe medical impairment can put everyone around you at risk as you drive.<br><br>

        Discuss the medical examination specifics with IEC DBA Drivers School. The most important things you can do before applying to CDL truck driving school are<a href="#" class="text-primary"> to stay healthy, avoid drugs, and maintain a clean record.</a> Driving charges, in particular, can prevent you from receiving a CDL from any CDL training company, but so can illegal drug use.
      </p>

      <span class="maintext">Graduate to Receive a Class A CDL</span>
      <p class="financing"><a href="#" class="text-primary">Commercial driver’s licenses, or CDLs,</a> are divided into different classes to ensure drivers have the proper training for specific commercial vehicles. Driving a tow truck isn’t the same as a double-trailer tractor-trailer, so you’ll need a Class A CDL to drive larger vehicles.<br><br>

      The two most common CDLs for commercial drivers are Class A and Class B licenses. Both allow you to drive professionally, but there are distinct reasons why you should consider choosing a Class A license school for your next career step.</p>

      <span class="maintext">What Is a Class A License?</span>
      <p class="financing">A <a href="#" class="text-primary">Class A CDL</a> has been required for interstate tractor-trailer travel since April 1992. Tractor-trailer driving opportunities represent some of the most highly paid and plentiful positions, so it’s a strong career move if you’re looking to become a professional truck driver.<br><br>

        If you’ve dreamed of seeing the country from the cab of a tractor-trailer, then a Class A license school is the first step to your career dreams. Completing a CDL license school opens the doors to a competitive salary and unique career opportunity as an over-the-road driver.<br><br>

        A Class A license is considered a universal commercial license. This is because it qualifies you to drive any Class B vehicle, so it opens up the most opportunities for you to be flexible with future 
      employment.</p>

      <span class="maintext">Explore Your Carrier Choices</span>
      <p class="financing">
        Graduate from one of the top free-choice CDL training companies, like IEC DBA Drivers School, to apply to any carrier you wish. Thanks to in-depth job placement assistance, you’ll have a wide range of
