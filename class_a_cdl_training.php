      <p class="financing">To become a commercial truck driver, you must obtain a CDL driver’s license. A Commercial Driver’s License or CDL is a license issued by the state to drivers employed as commercial drivers, operating trucks, buses, or other heavy vehicles on the road.<br><br>

        <span class="maintext">What type of CDL do I need?</span>
        <p class="financing">There are three types of CDL licenses you can study for. The type of CDL you obtain determines what type and weight of the vehicle you can drive safely, which impacts the type of truck driving job you can obtain.<br><br>

          The most popular option is the Class A CDL since it allows you to drive any truck with two or more axles. You can operate even the heaviest trucks available, including those with gross weights exceeding 26,000 pounds and towed vehicles exceeding 10,000 pounds. This allows you to drive tractor-trailers, flatbeds, and livestock carriers. A Class A CDL allows you to drive across state lines, which is crucial if you want to get the highest-paying truck driving jobs.<br><br>

        With a Class B CDL, you can operate any non-articulating commercial vehicle weighing 26,000 pounds or more and tow vehicles under 10,000 pounds. This includes dump trucks, straight trucks, box trucks, and delivery trucks. Class B CDLs are also used for driving large passenger buses within your states, such as city, school, and tourist buses.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-10 col-md-10 col-xl-10 col-lg-10">
        <p class="financing">On the other hand, a Class C CDL allows you to drive a vehicle weighing under 26 000 pounds, carrying 16 or more people, or transporting hazardous materials. To drive a tank truck, bus, HazMat vehicle, or triple trailer, you need a Class C CDL. Depending on what you will be transporting, you will also need an endorsement—such as Passenger (P) or Hazardous Material (HME).

        The Class A license allows you to drive the widest variety of commercial vehicles across state lines, including the heaviest trailers. For this reason, unless you plan only to drive a bus or small truck within your state, getting a Class A CDL is best to start your trucking career. </p>

        <h1 class="maintext">How do I get a Class A CDL?</h1>
        <p class="financing">You must enroll and complete a training program to receive a Class A CDL. Before enrolling in a training program and taking a Class A driver’s license exam, you’ll need to meet the age and medical requirements.<br><br>

          The minimum age to be eligible for interstate commercial driving employment is 21. There aren’t any regulations on maximum age, so you can continue to drive as long as you pass the medical requirements.<br><br>

          Medical CDL license requirements are determined by a certified medical examination. <br><br>

        A CDL certification requires you to pass a Class A CDL exam. Attending a CDL training program can prepare for this test and receive hands-on training in professional truck driving.</p>
