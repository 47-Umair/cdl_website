Residents of California who visit our Website may request that we do not automatically collect and track information about their online browsing activities. Such requests are often made via Web browser settings that control signals or other methods that provide consumers control over the gathering of personally identifiable information about their online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

<span class="maintext">2. DESIGNATING AN AUTHORIZED AGENT TO MAKE A REQUEST</span>
<p class="financing">Only you or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. If desired, you may designate an authorized agent to make a verifiable consumer request on your behalf by submitting such request to us via email at privacy@werner.com with “Request for Authorized Agent” in the subject line. Before taking action in response to such a request, we will require your authorized agent to verify his/her authority and identity.</p>

<span class="maintext">3. VERIFICATION OF REQUESTS</span>
<p class="financing">Before responding to your request to exercise your rights, we will verify your identity through reasonable verification measures. If we have a password-protected account with you, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account. If you are requesting the disclosure or deletion of Personal Information, we will require you to re-authenticate yourself before disclosing or deleting your Personal Information.
  <br><br>
  Our verification processes also may include requiring you to provide answers to questions pertaining to the information we have on file for you (e.g., your account number); requesting confirmation of the request using your email address on file; or calling the phone number we have on file for you to confirm the request.
  <br><br>
If we cannot verify your identity based on information we already have, we may request additional information from you. If this is necessary, we will only use the additional information for purposes of verifying your identity and for and fraud-prevention. And if we are unable to reasonably verify your identity (and thus unable to comply with your request), we will advise you why that is the case.</p>
<span class="maintext">4. DISABILITY ASSISTANCE</span>
<p class="financing">We are committed to ensuring that this Privacy Policy is accessible to everyone.  Individuals with difficulty accessing information in this Privacy Policy are encouraged to contact us via one of the submission methods noted in Section 1.</p>

<span class="maintext">RESPONSE TIMING AND FORMAT</span>
<p class="financing">We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact <br><br>

  We endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.<br><br>

  If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.<br><br>

  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.<br><br>

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

<span class="maintext">NON-DISCRIMINATION</span>
<p class="financing">We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
