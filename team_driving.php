        <span class="maintext">Team Truck Driving</span>
        <p class="financing">It’s pretty much what it sounds like. A truck driver and another truck driver agree to sign on with a carrier to make runs together. But why is driving with a partner an option? Team driving is all about keeping the truck in motion and the goods moving. When there are two drivers in a truck, one can take the wheel while the other relaxes or does whatever they do in their off-time. This keeps the freight moving along the highways and productivity at a high level.<br><br>

          Solo drivers are required to stop and take time off to sleep before they can resume work. Team driving solves that issue, and the reward is both drivers are paid for the combined mileage. The carrier wage is applied to the total mileage driven between the truck drivers and is split between both. Many times carriers will offer sign-on bonuses for team drivers or will reward referrals (if we assume that you referred your team driver).<br><br>

        A lot of factors go into figuring out how much money team drivers can make. Things like carrier rates for team drivers, specific company bonuses, the experience of the drivers, and the type of materials being hauled will be considered. While a single answer won’t cut it, we can tell you about the ways team drivers can earn more money than solo drivers. The best way to make the most out of your trucking career, though, is to stay knowledgeable and ask questions about wages with a carrier before signing on.</p>
        <span class="maintext">Determining Wages for Team Drivers</span>
        <p class="financing">Below are a couple of imaginary scenarios that help to understand the way team drivers earn more money compared to solo drivers. All of the figures are general and are not meant to represent any specific carrier wage. Things like bonuses, endorsements, and driver experience aren’t factored into the scenarios, either. The best results come from direct numbers provided by the carrier company you want to sign on with.</p>

        <span class="maintext">Why doesn’t everyone drive with a partner?</span>
        <p class="financing">The obvious answer is that it isn’t the easiest thing in the world to spend that much time in a truck with someone else. But it isn’t impossible! Just like in our scenario above, married couples that get along are a good fit for team driving. You’ll have to share a lot more than just the space in the truck. Consider that you will have to share nearly everything from food breaks and stops to radio station choices.<br><br>

        If you’re considering driving in a team as a career, make sure to have a healthy relationship with your other driver. If you’ve got that covered, then there’s very little stopping you from great truck driving wages!</p>
        <span class="maintext">Four Benefits of Team Truck Driving Jobs</span>
        <p class="financing">When people team drive, there are two of them, and they take turns with the driving responsibilities. That means the shipment can get to its destination faster than it would if there was only one driver, and it’s a way for the drivers to make extra money.<br><br>

        By switching off the driving, there’s very little to no downtime where a driver has to stop and sleep. The other driver can simply keep the truck moving during that time. Partners, friends, and spouses all make for good team driving pairs. People must get along well with one another if they’re going to spend that much time in a small space. Here are four of the main benefits of team truck driving jobs.</p>

        <span class="maintext">1. You Can Go Through School as a Team</span>
        <p class="financing">If you know someone you want to drive with, going through school as a team is a good way to do it. Once you’ve been through school, Werner has a great team driving program with many benefits for you and your driving partner. For example, you’ll get newer trucks and longer haul times, so Werner can help you make more money faster.
        Priority load-planning and more no-touch freight are also perks you’ll get when you drive as a team for Werner. Guaranteed weekly pay, sign-on bonuses, and extra money for hazmat shipments are other benefits of driving as a team for Werner, and all the trucks are two years old or less, with automatic transmissions and collision mitigation systems to make team truck driving safer and easier than ever before.</p>

        <span class="maintext">2. You Can Make Better Money</span>
        <p class="financing">When you and your partner drive as a team, it’s easier for you both to make good money. One will drive while the other rests or sleeps, and of course, you’ll both have some downtime or driving time together, as well. By going through truck driving school, you and your driving partner will have the chance to start on a career path that could work for both of you.</p>

        <span class="maintext">3. You Can Help Meet a High Demand for Drivers</span>
        <p class="financing">Right now, truck drivers are in demand more than they have been for a long time. Team truck driving is the way to get involved and help meet that demand. The more you can travel and get shipments delivered, the more work you can take on. It’s a good way to expand your horizons, spend time with a friend or someone else you’re close to, and help fill a void in the economy by team driving.</p>

        <span class="maintext">4. You Have Someone to Travel With</span>
        <p class="financing">Team driving can help keep you from being lonely on the road. You’ll have someone to work with and have adventures with and have someone who can help if you need it. In turn, the other person driving with you will have the same kind of help and support, and that can allow both of you to enjoy your careers more fully.</p>
