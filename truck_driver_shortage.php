        <span class="maintext">Truck Driver Shortage</span>
        <p class="financing">The American Trucking Association (ATA) predicts that if the current trend remains, the national truck driver shortage could surpass 160,000 in 2030. The ATA estimates that over the next ten years, the industry will need to recruit nearly 1,000,000 new drivers to replace retiring drivers, drivers who leave either voluntarily or involuntarily, and additional drivers for industry growth.<br><br>

        The current shortage of truck drivers is due to many factors, including:</p>
        <ul class="text-center lists">
          <li><p>A high average age of current drivers, which means many are retiring</p></li>
          <li><p>A deficient percentage of female drivers (7% of all drivers)</p></li>
          <li><p>Federally mandated age of 21 to drive commercially across state lines</p></li>
          <li><p>The inability of some drivers to pass a drug test</p></li>
          <li><p>COVID-19 pandemic and lifestyle decisions – pandemic-induced supply chain issues and an overall decision of some drivers to leave the industry</p></li>
          <li><p>Infrastructure and other issues – lack of parking options and traffic congestion can be challenging</p></li>
        </ul>

        <span class="maintext">The Good News</span>
        <p class="financing">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), employment of heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers is projected to grow 6% from 2020 to 2030, which is about the same pace as the average for all occupations1. The demand for commercial truck drivers means that driver pay has increased significantly. The BLS states the median annual wage for heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers was $47,130 in May 20202, which is higher than the median average wage of all workers ($41,950).<br><br>

        Truck driver pay is only one reason it offers people a stable career with job security. Other benefits of truck driving include:</p>
        <ul class="text-center lists">
          <li><p>Dental and medical insurance</p></li>
          <li><p>401k retirement plans</p></li>
          <li><p>Paid vacation and sick time</p></li>
          <li><p>Improved bonuses and more!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="financing">Companies can’t outsource truck driving, and current demand is high, with it expected to increase over the next decade.</p>
