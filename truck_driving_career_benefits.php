        <span class="maintext">Truck Driving Career Benefits</span>
        <p class="financing">There is no better time than now to have a career in truck driving. Not only is the demand high, but the benefits are vast.<br><br>

        If you’re interested in a career in the Truck Driving Industry, and you’ve met all CDL training requirements, congratulations! You’re considering entering a growing profession with great pay and some incredible benefits. Here are just a few you’ll find.</p>

        <span class="maintext">Excellent Pay</span>
        <p class="financing">Most people want to earn a good income. Not only does it pay the bills but aren’t you worth more? With a career in truck driving, the competitive pay ensures you’ll not only earn a good living but achieve much more than that. Truck Drivers make an average of $1,176* per week or $61,152* per year! Most careers have a set salary or hourly pay. Instead, truck drivers typically get paid by the mile. This rate varies depending on the company you drive for and your experience.</p>

          <span class="maintext">Job Security</span>
          <p class="financing">Job security is a significant factor in choosing a career. With a career in truck driving, demand is high. Consider this: The job that truck drivers do can’t be outsourced. That means no foreign company can do what they do. Not only that, truck drivers haul what America needs, the very essentials that keep the country running. Things like food, medical supplies, fuel, and more. Even during the pandemic, truck drivers still work to ensure we have everything we need to live. <br><br>
          The ATA estimates a shortage of nearly 80,000 Truck Drivers, and they expect the demand to continue rising throughout the decade. That means you are needed and also means higher pay than many other jobs. </p>

          <span class="maintext">Insurance Benefits</span>
          <p class="financing">No matter what type of job you have, insurance is essential. With a career in truck driving, you get options. Medical and dental insurance are standard perks in the truck driving industry. And there are options for life insurance as well – at competitive rates. <br><br>
          Werner offers life insurance, disability, HSA, health programs, health, dental, and vision insurance. </p>

          <span class="maintext">401K Retirement Savings Plans</span>
          <p class="financing">Why not save for your retirement while you travel the United States? In the past, many jobs offered a pension. Starting in the 80s, most jobs transitioned to a 401K plan. That is if they offer any type of savings plan at all. It’s a way of ensuring that you have money to live on when it’s time to relax and enjoy your retirement.<br><br>

            According to Investopedia:
            <span class="font-italic">
            Today, 401K plans remain a popular choice for investors, as they offer a flexible, proven way to save for retirement. At the end of the first quarter of 2019 (the most recent data available), over 55 million Americans took part in 401(k) plans, which held an estimated $5.7 trillion in assets.</span></p>

          <span class="maintext">State-of-the-Art Technology</span>
          <p class="financing">Being on the road certainly has its perks and having the top equipment makes a huge difference. At Werner Enterprises, the average age of trucks is just two years old. Along with new trucks, the technology is innovative and includes:</p> 
          <ul class="text-center lists">
            <li><p>A driver app and portal</p></li>
            <li><p>Leading-edge telematics device</p></li>
            <li><p>24hr maintenance assistance for when you need it</p></li>
            <li><p>Collision mitigation technology to keep you safer</p></li>
            <li><p>100% trailer tracking</p></li>
            <li><p>Truck navigation system so you always know exactly where to go</p></li>
          </ul>
          <span class="maintext">See America</span>
          <p class="financing">One of the best things about being a professional truck driver is getting to see the United States like no one else. You can take extra time to visit the Grand Canyon or see what it’s like in Times Square. And you’ll see the beauty of America’s landscape right from your window as you travel from coast to coast. 
            <br><br>
          Besides, who wants to be stuck in an office cubicle or tied down to a boss who is always telling you what to do? Of course, you have to follow the rules, and unless you’re an owner-operator, you have a boss. But while you’re on the open road, it’s up to you to decide when to eat, what to listen to on the radio, or when you can take a break. </p>

          <span class="maintext">Team Truck Driving</span>
          <p class="financing">Team truck driving allows couples and friends to drive in shifts and earn more money. You can accept longer drives and more hours as a partner since switching spots is all it takes to keep on trucking! In fact, team truck drivers can sometimes make up to $10K more a year at<a href="werner_enterprises.php" class="text-primary"> Werner Enterprises. </a></p>

          <span class="maintext">Bring Your Pet</span>
          <p class="financing">To many of us, our pets are our family, and a career in truck driving means that you can bring your pet as a travel companion. This benefit depends on the carrier you choose, but many allow you to bring your furry friend along for the ride.
