        <span class="maintext">Truck Driving School Cost: Everything You Need to Know</span>
        <p class="financing">IEC DBA Drivers School can help train you for a new career as a Professional Truck Driver in as little as one month. The trucking industry is the backbone of America and is essential to keep grocery stores, hospitals, and every American supplied with the goods they need. It’s a job that cannot be outsourced and is recession-proof. And truck driving school cost isn’t as much as you’d think – especially with tuition reimbursement benefits offered by various trucking carriers.<br><br>

        A career in truck driving pays well, has many benefits, and allows you to see the country right from your truck. To become a long-haul truck driver, you must have a Class A CDL. Driving a semi-truck isn’t the same as driving other vehicles, so getting trained is a must to prepare for the Class A CDL test. Not only does a truck driving school give you hands-on experience, but you’ll also have a wealth of advantages you can’t find elsewhere. Here’s everything you need to know about becoming a Professional Truck Driver and the cost of CDL training.</p>

        <span class="maintext">What is Truck Driving School?</span>
        <p class="financing">If you want to become a truck driver, the truck driving school prepares you for this. A hands-on truck driving school and CDL training center allow you to start a new career – sometimes in as little as about a month. 

          You learn how to drive with genuine training behind the wheel and learn what it takes to pass the test for your Class A CDL. The commercial driver’s license (CDL) test is required to drive a large truck in the United States. To be more exact: <br><br>
          <span class="ml-5 fw-bold font-italic">You need a Class A CDL License to operate any combination of vehicles with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is over 10,000 pounds. Vehicles requiring a Class A CDL license are primarily tractor-trailers driving long distances.</span><br><br>
          We have automatic transmission trucks and state-of-the-art training equipment. We have been training students for over 30 years and have over 160,000 graduates.<br><br>

          IEC DBA truck driver training schools include computer labs and spacious classrooms, specially designed field-driving courses, and late-model tractor-trailers only for student training.<br><br>

          Our campuses are located all across the United States, and we ensure that you have help with job placement upon graduation.

        <span class="maintext">What Is CDL Training school like?</span>
        <p class="financing">IEC DBA Drivers School has a training program that includes things like:</p>
        <ul class="text-center lists">
          <li><p>Department of Transportation compliance laws. You’ll also learn about trip planning and map reading.</p></li>
          <li><p>Hands-on driving in real-world situations and at our practice facility. You don’t just read about what to do – you get to do it.</p></li>
          <li><p>Identifying preventive maintenance. Learn how to identify issues on large trucks.</p></li>
          <li><p>Hooking and unhooking. You’ll also learn turning and backing procedures in our industry-standard 53-foot trailers.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="financing">Of course, this isn’t all you learn but represents a few of the highlights. Our CDL training focuses on safety and how to prepare for your new career in Truck Driving. You’ll learn all you need to know to start work as soon as a company hires you because we offer real-world training. You don’t just stare at a computer or books all day; you get to drive and learn the ins and outs of being on the road full time.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xl-5 col-lg-5">
       <span class="maintext">What About the Cost?</span>
       <p class="financing">We offer in-house financing to those who qualify to help cover the cost of tuition. For those who qualify, this is an ideal way to get started, but there are other routes, too.
        <br>

        Trucking carriers that recruit from IEC DBA may offer up to 100 percent tuition reimbursement after graduation while working for the carrier, and you are free to choose whom you work for after graduation. For instance, Werner Enterprises provides tuition reimbursement and even perks like a sign-on bonus after graduation and upon employment. Other schools sometimes say that you can go for free. In reality, those students have to sign up to work for specific carriers for at least a year or two. Some find out that they’re being paid very little and working long hours.<br>

        That doesn’t equal out to you making a good living. Plus, it’s more like you are paying back the free schooling they promised you. We don’t do that here. There is no employment contract, and instead, we focus on preparing students to be the most competent and confident Professional Truck Drivers they can be.<br>

      No matter what, make sure you read the fine print. If you break a contract, then you owe your tuition back to the trucking company you signed with in some cases. It’s a win for them either way. Be very careful when looking at companies offering deals that seem too good to be true. Sometimes, it is.</p>
